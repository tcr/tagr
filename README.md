# tagr

*HTML manipulation for web apps.*

Tagr is a clean interface to the DOM. To complement your `<canvas>` context,
create an HTML context. Never construct anything but tags and strings, and never
have to mix and match CSS selectors to target your elements.

Combine Tagr with Now.js, and you can compose entire widgets on the server--
styles, event handlers, and markup--and run them on the client. Tagr
serializes to HTML and CSS, so you get fast rendering times, with the
flexibility of Tagr's clean and extensible API.

Tagr, minified, is just 10kb.

## How it works

Tagr ensures you're never interact with the DOM directly. Instead, work with
JSON, define your own relative stylesheets and events, and build up widgets
to use in your application.

**TODO** document this. But hey, check out `todo.js` for a demo
