<h1>Tagr Demo</h1>

<p>Tagr modules are self-contained, by design. It's up to the author to properly
separate their models, views, and controllers. The upshot of Tagr modules is that
you are working entirely in the language of JavaScript: no more maintaining files
in various languages, where widget code becomes very distant from each other.</p>

<script src="todo.js"></script>
<p style="font-size: 12px"><a href="todo.js">View the source: todo.js</a></p>

<p>To embed this TODO list, all we had to do was include:</p>

<blockquote>
	<pre>&lt;script src=&quot;todo.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>
